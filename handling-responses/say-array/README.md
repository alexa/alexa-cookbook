#### Ingredients
## say-array <a id="title"></a>

#### What you will learn

If you have an array of items you want to say to the user, use this ```sayArray()``` function to format the list with
commas and a connecting word before the final item.

For example, if your list has

    var myRequest = ['apples','oranges','strawberries'];

Pass in two arguments: the list array, and the connecting word (`and` or `or`).
 + ```sayArray(myRequest, 'and')```   the store has apples, oranges, and strawberries
 + ```sayArray(myRequest, 'or')```    choose either apples, oranges, or strawberries
